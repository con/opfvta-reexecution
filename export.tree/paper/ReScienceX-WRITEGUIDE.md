## Foreword

This page provides guidance on how to prepare a submission for ReScience
X, including the types of submissions we distinguish, key aspects and
material that must be included in submissions, and the structure we
expect submissions and supplementary material to follow.

ReScience X considers original empirical research from all disciplines,
spanning natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, humanities
and engineering.  Authors working on reproducing results from published
computational work are invited to submit their work to our sister
journal, [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io).

The aim of the review process is to provide actionable feedback to
authors, and contribute to the improvement of the work, until it meets
ReScience quality standards.  We focus on quality, and reviewers are
instructed not to base their evaluation on trends, novelty, or on the
perceived importance of the results submitted or that of the work
reproduced.

Authors planning a submission are strongly advised to contact the
[ReScience X editorial
team](http://rescience.org/x/about/editorialTeam), and to liaise with
the original authors, if possible, before starting work on their
project.  We encourage collegiate and fruitful collaboration, and hope
these early interactions can strengthen the proposed work.  If the
original authors are not involved in the project, ReScience X editors
will invite them to comment on the finalised article, upon acceptance
for publication.

ReScience X is organised in Sections, and our submission portal follows
the [OJS submission
workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/authoring).  Authors
are advised to go through the OJS documentation, and can even take [a
short online training
module](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/writing-for-publication/), if
needed.

\ ![OJS Editorial and Publishing
Workflow](http://rescience.org/public/site/images/OJS-EditorialWorkflow.png)

We follow an opt-out Open Peer-Review scheme, where reviewers are
identified and reviews are made public, unless agreed with the editor.
Should authors feel the need to submit their work anonymously, they are
invited to contact the [ReScience X editorial
team](http://rescience.org/x/about/editorialTeam) as soon as possible.
Upon acceptance for publication, editors can append a commentary, or a
summary of the topic, and the authors of the original work may be
invited to comment.

Submissions are made by creating an account on the [submission
portal](http://rescience.org/x/about/submissions), and must include a
Cover Letter and an original Research Article, using [ReScience
Templates](https://github.com/ReScience-X/policies/tree/master/templates)
and submitted as both source (Open Office, Microsoft Word, LaTeX) and
PDF files.

Submissions cannot be under review in another academic venue at the same
time, but authors can disclose their work as they see fit, e.g. on
social media, as a preprint, in a blog post, or at a conference. Authors
retain copyright on any work submitted, and a license must be assigned
prior to acceptance for publication. [CC-BY
4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) is preferred. Authors
grant full rights to ReScience X to publish, distribute and promote
their work.

Upon acceptance, submissions will be made available on the [ReScience X
website](http://rescience.org/x), indexed in relevant search engines,
and advertised on social media.


## Submissions

### Cover Letter

A cover letter must accompany a submission, using the [ReScience X
Template](https://github.com/ReScience-X/policies/tree/master/templates),
and submitted as a PDF on the submission portal.

The cover letter must include the following information:
* the full names and affiliations of all authors, who must all have
* agreed to the submission;
    <!-- TODO: establish CREDIT for all authors -->
* the email address of the corresponding author; this information is
* displayed on every submission, and all communication between the
* corresponding author and ReScience X Editorial Board is done through
* the submission portal.  the full reference to the original paper,
* including DOI if available; a brief summary (500w max) of the
* submission; a URL to an [OSF project](https://osf.io), and to its
* [registration](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930893) if
* it has been performed (preferred). This OSF project should be used to
* centralise access to all files, material, documents, and links to
* online repositories used in the work submitted; a list of at least 3
* potential reviewers, with contact information and a statement , and if
* applicable a list of at most 3 people who should not be contacted for
* review.


### Original Research Article, and supplementary material

An original Research Article must be using the [ReScience X
Template](https://github.com/ReScience-X/policies/tree/master/templates),
and submitted as a PDF file on the submission portal. It should follow
the guidelines and conventions in the academic field of the original
paper.

The associated OSF project should centralise all supplementary material,
raw txt/tex/docx/odf/etc files, and rendered PDF files, as well as links
to online repositories hosting the material not on OSF; e.g. source
code, curated repositories. Once accepted for publication, a submission
will be copy-edited and relevant links added to the finalised PDF
article, before indexation.

A README document should contain a description of the structure of the
OSF project.

All supplementary material should be consolidated and curated in the
accompanying OSF project, according to FAIR principles (Wilkinson et
al., 2016),  and include:
* the raw data, clearly labelled, for every single experiment; the
* final, processed (normalised) data, clearly annotated, for every
* single experiment; the complete list of material, hardware and
* software used, from collection to analysis, including version numbers
* and URLs to vendors and manufacturers, as well as calibration scheme
* and data; if possible, the actual stimuli/input and scripts used to
* run the experiments; the complete list of essential laboratory and
* data processing methods and protocols; all the scripts used to analyse
* the data and produce the figures included in the Research Article, and
* in the supplementary material.


## Types of submissions

### Reproductions of methods -- "The method is the same, results are,
hopefully, consistent"

We refer to the definition of reproducibility proposed by Peng (2011):
the purpose of a reproduction is to assert the outcome of a particular
experimental setup, to assert that a given method achieves consistent
results.

In other words, a reproduction is an account of the faithful application
of the original work; if at all possible, that means the same setup, the
same scripts, the same software, the same stimuli and apparatus, the
same kind of participants or subjects, the same chemical compounds, the
same kind of equipment and facilities, the same analyses, etc. This may
be more easily done in some disciplines than others. This would include,
for instance, the measurement of chemical reactions, with raw material
that will be of the exact same composition as in the original
experiment.

The Research Article should include, and will be assessed on the
following items. Any discrepancy with the original paper should be
stated explicitly:
* a brief summary of the original paper, and contextual information; a
* description of the aim of the reproduction, clearly specifying what
* aspect of the method is being reproduced and to what end; a detailed
* description of the method under scrutiny: authors must share the
* material used, scripts, blueprints, calibration scheme and data, etc,
* in the accompanying OSF project; a statement of the expected outcome
* as per original paper, and the authors's hypotheses; annotated
* experimental factors, coding and randomization schemes; details of how
* samples were constituted (e.g. a priori method to determine sample
* sizes, and if no power analysis was performed then a description of
* stopping criteria, recruitment procedures, incentives, etc); details
* of the experimental designs, including explicit references to files
* hosted in the supplementary materials; inclusion and exclusion
* criteria; whether experimenters were blind to group assignment, and
* outcome assessment; a detailed account of the analyses performed, and
* any discrepancy from the original paper; a review and discussion of
* the results; a conclusion.

### Replications of results -- "The method can be different, results
are, hopefully, exactly the same"

While reproducibility is considered a minimal standard to evaluate a
scientific claim, replicability (of results) is often considered the
ultimate standard by which a result can be trusted.

The purpose of a replication is to assert a trait or a property that may
be considered universal, within a particular context. A replication is
an account of the attempt to perform a similar experiment as presented
in the original paper; unlike a reproduction, a replication needs not be
as faithful, as it is understood that some aspects of the original work
cannot be reproduced, or actually need to be tested differently. For
instance, an experiment in linguistics on English participants, may not
qualify as a reproduction if it is performed on German participants.
Similarly, an experiment that relies on the use of particular piece of
equipment does not qualify as a reproduction, if it is performed on a
similar piece of equipment but produced by a competing manufacturer,
which may be performing measurements in very different way.

Submissions should include
* a brief summary of the original paper, and contextual information; a
* description of the aim of replication, clearly specifying what aspect
* of the results is replicated and to what end; a detailed description
* of the method: if at all possible, authors must share the raw material
* used, scripts, blueprints, etc; a statement of the expected outcome as
* per original paper; a detailed account of the analyses performed, and
* any discrepancy from the original paper; a review and discussion of
* the results; a conclusion.

### Re-analyses

The purpose of a re-analysis is to assert the knowledge gained from a
given dataset, either reproducing the same analyses, by means of a
different methodology, or pooling different sources of data together.
Not all science needs be producing new data, and we strongly encourage
the recycling of data, with a view to formulating new insights.

### Reproducibility toolkit ...

### Open letters / Editorials The purpose of an open letter / editorial
is to provide authors with the room to share their experience of a given
field. The replication of research is a sensitive topic, because of the
way scientific research is evaluated by funding agencies, academic
institutions and the general public.

### Reviews The purpose of a review is to assimilate the knowledge of a
large body of work, to assist the formulation of a coherent,
comprehensive and stable building block in the edifice of science.
Reviews can take several forms, dictated by shared practices in academic
communities.  All reviews must include a one-page summary accessible to
a lay audience.


### Peer review policy

ReScience X follows a strict open peer review scheme, whereby reviewers
of papers submitted are disclosed to the authors. The workflow is based
on implementation by the Centre for Open Science. A submission “unit” is
a Project in the Open Science Framework, containing links and hooks to
all the material necessary to the submission. Pre-registrations are
immutable, timestamped snapshots of OSF Projects, and the entire review
process is logged and made public upon acceptance for publication.
Authors retain control of the Project after publication, but published
papers are themselves immutable, timestamped snapshots of the OSF
Project, which are publicly available, searchable and indexed. Open
comments to registered users are moderated.

Whenever possible, we strongly encourage authors of replications to
engage with the authors of the replicated work, even before they invest
efforts to produce new data. We also recognise that direct collaboration
is not always possible, and therefore seek to foster collaborative,
open, dispassionate and purposeful dialogue.


### Submission and review guidelines

A step-by-step guide to submitting work to ReScience X is available.  A
submission must include a cover letter and a manuscript, and may include
data, scripts, source code, software and images/VMs, amongst other
things. Wherever applicable, authors are encouraged to provide as much
detail and material to allow for the reproduction of their work—that is
the faithful reproduction of the work and data.
