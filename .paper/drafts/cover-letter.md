Summary: 
(original abstract)

```
Ascending dopaminergic projections from neurons located in the Ventral
Tegmental Area (VTA) are key to the etiology, dysfunction, and control
of motivation, learning, and addiction. Due to the evolutionary
conservation of this nucleus and the extensive use of mice as disease
models, establishing an assay for VTA dopaminergic signaling in the
mouse brain is crucial for the translational investigation of
motivational control as well as of neuronal function phenotypes for
diseases and interventions. In this article we use optogenetic
stimulation directed at VTA dopaminergic neurons in combination with
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a method widely used in
human deep brain imaging. We present a comprehensive assay producing the
first whole-brain opto-fMRI map of dopaminergic activation in the mouse,
and show that VTA dopaminergic system function is consistent with its
structural VTA projections, diverging only in a few key aspects. While
the activation map predominantly highlights target areas according to
their relative projection densities (e.g., strong activation of the
nucleus accumbens and low activation of the hippocampus), it also
includes areas for which a structural connection is not well established
(such as the dorsomedial striatum). We further detail the variability of
the assay with regard to multiple experimental parameters, including
stimulation protocol and implant position, and provide evidence-based
recommendations for assay reuse, publishing both reference results and a
reference analysis workflow implementation.
